First we have to go first Miscellaneous catagory 


Go and click to the FF.CO challange and 
downlode all jpg  file.
We will first open the flag.jpg file. 
There is a single text inside a picture.
We need to get that text out. 
For that we can use an online tool.

That's the text we got after using the tools.

the text is : uryyb{purpx_gur_uvag_cebcreyl}

We need to analyze this text. After analyzing that 
text we came to know that, it is the Encoded text of a ROT-13.

We will use a tool to decrypt the encoded text of Rot-13.

After decoding, he gave us a text

hello{check_the_hint_properly}


He told us to look at Hint. Hint means hint.jpg file.
 After opening that file, we could see nothing but white.

We have to forensicize this file so when we used the exif tool it gave us the flag.


The flag is: wtfctf{IHDR_h34d3r_w4s_th3_k3y}
